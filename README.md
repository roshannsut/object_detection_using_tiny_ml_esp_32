# object_detection_using_tiny_ml_esp_32
This project focuses on implementing real-time object detection using TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) on the ESP32 microcontroller. TinyML enables the deployment of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices like the ESP32, making it possible to bring intelligence to the edge.
